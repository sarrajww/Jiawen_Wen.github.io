abstract: >-
  Through integrated GWAS, MWAS, and mGWAS analysis of 827 foxtail millet cultivars, 
  we identified 257 rhizoplane microbial biomarkers associated with agronomic traits and revealed that plant genes controlling immunity, 
  metabolism, and nutrient uptake shape microbiota composition, which in turn influences plant growth in a genotype-dependent manner.
