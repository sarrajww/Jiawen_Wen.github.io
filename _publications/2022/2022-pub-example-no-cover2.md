abstract: >-
  Through multi-tissue transcriptomic analysis of Rheum tanguticum, we discovered that high expression of chlorophyll degradation enzymes (RtPPH, RtPao, and RtRCCR) in purple leaf samples contributes to their distinctive coloration, providing valuable insights into the genetic basis of pigmentation in this important medicinal plant.
