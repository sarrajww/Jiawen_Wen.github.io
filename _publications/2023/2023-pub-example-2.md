  Through genome-wide association study analysis of 66 citrus rootstock-scion combinations and their corresponding leaf, root, and rhizosphere metagenomes, we identified host genetic determinants associated with microbiome composition and function, revealing that plant genes involved in immunity, transport, hormones, and metabolism shape microbial communities, while bacterial colonization traits differ among plant compartments.
