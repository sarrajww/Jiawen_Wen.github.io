  <p>
     I am a Ph.D. student in Plant Pathology at University of Florida, where my research focuses on understanding and combating Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening disease, one of the most devastating citrus diseases worldwide. Using an integrated multi-omics approach, I study the complex interactions between citrus plants and the bacterial pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas).
  </p>
  <p>
    My current research employs cutting-edge genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics to unravel the molecular mechanisms of disease progression and host resistance <a href="https://orcid.org/0009-0008-1976-0698" target="_blank">(orcid)</a>. 
    I'm particularly interested in identifying genetic factors that contribute to HLB tolerance in citrus varieties. 
    Through comparative genomics and network analysis, I aim to develop novel strategies for improving citrus resistance to this devastating disease.
